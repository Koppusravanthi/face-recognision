Project Title: Face Recognition System

File Structure:

The face recognition project file typically consists of the following folders and files:

Folders:

1. data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the face recognition model.
    - training_data: Images of faces used to train the model.
    - testing_data: Images of faces used to test the model.
2. models: Stores trained face recognition models.
3. utils: Contains utility functions for image processing, feature extraction, and face detection.
4. results: Stores output results, such as recognized faces, accuracy metrics, and visualizations.

Files:

1.  Main Python script that implements face recognition functionality.
2 Script for detecting faces in images using libraries like OpenCV.
3.  Script for extracting facial features using techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
4.  Script for training the face recognition model using datasets.
5.  Script for testing the trained model on testing datasets.
6. requirements.txt: File listing dependencies required to run the project.
7.  Project documentation file.
